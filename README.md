# To-Do-List-in-react.js

In order to launch the project

Please follow the steps below:

commands to create a react app and launch it

-npx create-react-app my-app
-cd my-app
-npm start to launch the app in your browser

then delete all the content of the src file of my-app and replace it by the content of the src file
it with the content of the src file downloaded from To-Do-List

I used Bulma, the css framework. You will need to install it too
-cd my-app // in your directory
-npm install bulma
